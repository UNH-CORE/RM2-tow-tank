UNH RM2 tow tank experiment
===========================

This is a repository for data and processing code from the UNH RM2 tow tank
experiment.


## Getting started

We recommend using the
[Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads)
(Python 3.5) since it includes most dependencies. The remaining
can be installed by executing

    pip install progressbar33 pxl

After installing all dependencies, execute `python plot.py` to generate
figures from the experiment.
