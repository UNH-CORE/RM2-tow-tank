# Test plan, 2014 RM2 experiment

## Goals
  * Acquire a Reynolds number independent dataset for the DOE RM2 turbine.
    * Design and build an appropriate turbine model.
    * Acquire full device performance curves are multiple Re, to attempt to
      find convergence.
    * Once convergence is found, acquire another performance curve at that
      Re. 
    * Acquire a detailed wake flow map in the near-wake using acoustic 
      Doppler velocimetry.
