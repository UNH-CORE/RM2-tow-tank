==========

* Checked tightness on YZ traverse screws
* Made a pointer bracket for finding the turbine's zero angle. Found the
  location by putting an I-beam across the front edge of the frame and
  measuring 2.177 inches away, 8.625 inches down from the blade tip.
* Degreased Vectrino mounting strut for applying gaffer's tape.
* Cleaned and greased YZ traverse linear bearings. 
* Got turbine and Vectrino installed at about 5:30 PM.
