2015.02.03 turbine assembly
===========================

Notes
-----

  * Dowel pin holes inside struts seemed to be too deep. Filled the bottoms
    of the holes with approximately 3/16" long 4-40 nylon threaded rod.
    Works fine. 
  * Did not have 1 3/8 inch long 3/8-24 SHCS, so used 1 1/4 long. Still 
    around 7/16 inch thread engagement. This would mean a 4000 psi shear
    stress on the threads for a 1000 lbf axial force, which is a very conservative
    case.
  * All turbine hardware is at final torque.
  * 3D CAD is up-to-date but 2D drawings are not. 
  * Used a lot of marine grade grease on any bare aluminum or stainless to help
    prevent corrosion. 
  * Overall everything looks good and the turbine should be installed 
    tomorrow.
